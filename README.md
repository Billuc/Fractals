# Fractals
A personnal project about fractals

I have always been fascinated by fractals. Fractals are self-repeating forms, that I find kinda beautiful.
Therefore, I made my own fracal generator. It isn't more complicated because I only wanted to experiment on fractals and on how they are generated.
I will maybe include more complicated forms like a Mandelbrot set in the future.
